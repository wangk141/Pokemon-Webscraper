# Webscraper
Webscrape data from popular Pokemon sites to create a Pokemon card database.  It uses Selenium to web scrape, MySQL to connect to SQL databases and Python to write in.

Possible uses?

1) Pokemon Card App
2) Quick Look-up by regex matching
3) etc.

Still to do:
1) Needs threading, its slow but it works
2) Needs to test edge cases better
